Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Make it count, play it straight
Don't look back, don't hesitate
When you go big time
What you want, what you feel
Never quit, and make it real
When you roll big time (oh-oh)
Hey (oh), hey (oh)
Listen to your heart now (eh)
Hey (oh), hey (oh)
Don't you feel the rush?
Hey (oh), hey (oh)
Better take your shot now
Oh-oh, oh-oh (hey), oh-oh, oh-oh
Go and shake it up, what you gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time.
